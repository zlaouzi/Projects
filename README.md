## Project Description

Corona Archive is a web service for tracking, displaying, evaluating, and
archiving of the Corona infections in a particular location. The web service will be accessible to
four types of users: 
- Visitors: Citizens or visitors can use the web service to indicate whether they have
entered a particular place and when they have done so.
- Places: Places which are frequently visited by people, such as clubs, pubs, restaurants,
cinemas etc. can use the web service to get access to a QR code, which uniquely
identifies their place. Citizens can scan this QR code to record their presence at that
place.
- Agency: The agency or the evaluation client can use the web service to generate coronarelated reports by collecting data from the database.
- Hospital: Hospitals can use the web service to mark people as infected and track anyone
else that has been in contact with an infected person.
